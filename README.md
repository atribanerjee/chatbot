## Future improvement

- Work on GPT3 files to improve conversational interaction, for example:
    * remember things said 1 day ago
    * understand what "it" represents in a sentence
    * idea: work on the pretext file
- Audio button
    * has to click on the button again to stop recording
    * not as smooth, might be better to use websocket (the program is currently using polling to get real time transcript)
    * Mixed content issue: recorder.js used requires https but GPT3 is currently using http. The user has to enable mixed content (can be done on Chrome and Firefox)
- Backend:
    * add more feature using the audio data
