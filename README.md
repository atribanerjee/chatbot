# Chatbot

This program is an AI chatbot web application that uses GPT3 to generate a response. The chatbot helps the users perform some searching with a more friendly user interface and interaction. It provides a simple answer straight away without having to scroll through all the Google search results. Also, it displays the top 10 google search results so that the user can go through the websites. The user can also click on the "show image" quick button to view the top 10 images from Google search.

## Heroku

A demo is deployed on Heroku.
Currently working version: https://web-easychat.herokuapp.com/

cd backend
# Setup and activate virtualenv
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Setup Django
./manage.py migrate

```

## React js to javascript conversion instructions

```bash
# Enter Django project folder
cd frontend
# run webpack
npm run dev
# the javascript files are located at: backend/myapp/static/myapp/build
```


## Future improvement

- Work on GPT3 files to improve conversational interaction, for example:
    * remember things said 1 day ago
    * understand what "it" represents in a sentence
    * idea: work on the pretext file
- Audio button
    * not as smooth, might be better to use websocket (the program is currently using polling to get real time transcript)
    * Mixed content issue: recorder.js used requires https but GPT3 is currently using http. The user has to enable mixed content in order to make it work (can be done on Chrome and Firefox)
    * Audio should be sent to the server when there is a pause in the speech (ideally)
- Backend:
    * add more feature using the audio data
